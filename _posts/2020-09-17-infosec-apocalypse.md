> Tools like Blackduck, WhiteSource, Checkmarx, Veracode are exploding in popularity ... These tools are quickly making their way into SOC2 and SDLC policies across industry, and if your language or new infrastructure tool isn’t supported by them there’s little chance you will get the previously already tenuous approval to use them. This sets the already high bar for adoption much higher. As you might expect, vendors will only implement support for languages that meet some threshold for profitability of their tools. Not only do you need to build a modern set of tools for your language to compete, now you also need support from external vendors. - [The Infosec Apocalypse](https://blog.rickasaurus.com/2020/08/31/The-Infosec-Apocalypse.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24501803)
