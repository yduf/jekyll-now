## [Why use SPI?](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/16349)

I2C lets you connect many devices to a single bus (two wires, plus ground) so it would be the preferred choice if you needed to interrogate a substantial number of devices, perhaps fairly infrequently. However the speed of SPI could be more relevant for situations where you need to output rapidly (eg. a LED strip) or input rapidly (eg. an ADC converter). - [Nick Gammon](http://www.gammon.com.au/spi)

### [SPI debugging](http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11329)

The code below demonstrates how you can achieve this by sending debugging "prints" out from the device you are testing, via SPI, to a second processor. The second processor simply sits there awaiting incoming bytes, and then dumps them out its serial port. Thus you effectively get a second serial port, via SPI.

This is suitable for debugging inside an interrupt service routine (ISR) because doing the SPI.transfer does not use interrupts.
