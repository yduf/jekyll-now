> [VSCode Debug Visualizer](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/tree/master/extension) is a VSCode extension that allows you to visualize data structures in your editor. This can be useful for visualizing watched values during debugging. I've found the extension can be helpful to visualize plots, tables, arrays, histograms and trees. - [Visualize Data Structures in VSCode](https://addyosmani.com/blog/visualize-data-structures-vscode/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24519214)
