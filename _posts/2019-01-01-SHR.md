### Can I expand an SHR volume with larger drives, such as 1TB to 3TB?

Yes, you can expand an SHR volume by changing the drives one at a time, and allow the DiskStation Manager to repair the volume. As soon as enough redundant storage is available, the SHR volume will expand the usable storage capacity.

### Can I expand an SHR volume with additional drives, such as 5 x 1TB to 15 x 1TB drives?

Yes, you can expand an SHR volume by adding additional drives to the existing array, especially for those who want to expand their storage due to their budget or storage needs.

Note that if you expand an SHR volume with more drives, your Synology NAS may require a lot of time to make all the installed drives usable. We suggest you a quick way for expansion: Schedule the time for expansion, and expand the drives when your Synology NAS is in use. After all, expanding the drives is more time-efficient than adding more drives.
