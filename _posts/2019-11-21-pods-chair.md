> The Playa Crawler is what's considered a "mutant vehicle" or "art car" and is a piece of kinetic art. I made it to be used as my own personal vehicle to get around at Burning Man and i wanted something interesting and unique so I created a chair that walks with the legs. the leg linkage was invented by Theo Jansen, a Dutch artist who creates this massive walking sculptures called Strandbeest that walk along the beach being pushed by the wind. - [Playa crawler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzehmObSjAE) - [Strandbeest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LewVEF2B_pM)
