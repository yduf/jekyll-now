> Generally, the following is a list of small, easy-to-integrate, portable libraries which are usable from C and/or C++, and should be able to be compiled on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. - [nothings/single_file_libs](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs)

- [sgorsten/linalg](https://github.com/sgorsten/linalg#matrices) - inspired by the syntax of popular shading and compute languages and is intended to serve as a lightweight alternative to projects such as GLM, Boost.QVM or Eigen in domains such as computer graphics, computational geometry, and physical simulation.

- [voidah/archive](https://github.com/voidah/archive) - Simple, compact, endian-safe and header-only serialization/deserialization for C++

- [NanoJPEG](https://keyj.emphy.de/nanojpeg/) - a compact JPEG decoder

- [MicorPather](http://www.grinninglizard.com/MicroPather/) - a path finder and A* solver (astar or a-star) written in platform independent C++ that can be easily integrated into existing code. MicroPather focuses on being a path finding engine for video games but is a generic A* solver.
