> One of the benefits to Heimdall is you can add a link to absolutely anything, whether it's intrinsically supported or not. With a generic item, you just fill in the name, background colour, add an icon if you want (if you don't a default Heimdall icon will be used), and enter the link url and it will be added. - [heimdall](https://heimdall.site/)
