## [Lecture 1 | Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4)

Lecture 1 gives an introduction to the field of computer vision, discussing its history and key challenges. We emphasize that computer vision encompasses a wide variety of different tasks, and that despite the recent successes of deep learning we are still a long way from realizing the goal of human-level visual intelligence.

## [Lecture 2 | Image Classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUX-nOEjG0)

Lecture 2 formalizes the problem of image classification. We discuss the inherent difficulties of image classification, and introduce data-driven approaches. We discuss two simple data-driven image classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Classifiers, and introduce the concepts of hyperparameters and cross-validation.
