## [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax)

- The basis is **MiniMax**,  a literal implementation would involve 2 methods that take turns (mutually recursive), 1 for each side.

- Lazy programmers turn this into **NegaMax**, 
one method with a strategically placed - operator.

- **Alpha/Beta pruning** is keeping track of a Window of best moves (over multiple depths) to detect dead branches.
