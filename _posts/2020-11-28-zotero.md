> Zotero is, at the most basic level, a reference manager. It is designed to store, manage, and cite bibliographic references, such as books and articles. In Zotero, each of these references constitutes an item. More broadly, Zotero is a powerful tool for collecting and organizing research information and sources. - [Home](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25230582)
