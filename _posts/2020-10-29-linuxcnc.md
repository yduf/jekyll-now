# Configuration
## [Latency-Test](http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Latency-Test)
- If your "Max Jitter" number is less than about **15-20** microseconds (15000-20000 nanoseconds), the computer should give **very nice** results with software stepping. 
- If the Max Jitter is more like **30-50** microseconds, you can still get **good** results, but your maximum step rate might be a little disappointing, especially if you use microstepping or have very fine pitch leadscrews. 
- If the numbers are **100 uS or more** (100,000 nanoseconds), then the PC is **not a good** candidate for software stepping.

# [BIOS/Hardware config](http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TroubleShooting#Checking_the_RealTime_subsystem)

- [Disable APM and ACPI bios settings](http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TroubleShooting#APM_and_ACPI_bios_settings)
Turn everything off that you can. Any power saving, anything related to suspending, cpu frequency scaling, etc. 
	- Enabling ACPI could be the only way to get access to local APIC timer (much lower latency than PIC), as new mainboards do not come with legacy support of MPTABLEs. 
	- Disable C1E power-saving feature in BIOS (could save about ~10-15ms on recent CPUs), this feature is activated regardless of ACPI or APM, thus needs to be disabled independently. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface) for more information on this. 
	- If you have a CPU that is C-state capable, add the following line to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub: "idle=poll" and run update-grub. The "idle=poll" keeps the CPU in a loop checking to see if it is needed rather then it entering C1 waiting for a wakeup call. I've seen latencies go from 30-50us to around 4us (1-2us even) on 6 different systems. [RealTime](http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RealTime)
    
## Multicore
- [The Isolcpus Boot Parameter And GRUB2](http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?The_Isolcpus_Boot_Parameter_And_GRUB2)
- [Reducing latency on multicore pc's](https://forum.linuxcnc.org/18-computer/25927-reducing-latency-on-multicore-pc-s-success) - initial max jitter value was 30000ns to the current value of less than 4000ns:
	- disable Vanderpool Technology (cpu vitualization stuff for vm's)
	- disable C1E support
	- enable TM support (temperature monitoring - will throttle cpu if it overheats e.g. because of fan malfunction - will mess things up but better than a crash and toasted chip)
