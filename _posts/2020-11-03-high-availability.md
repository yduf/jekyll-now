> Availability is the percentage of time an application is performing as expected (not to be confound with uptime). - Architecting for reliability on AWS (pluralsight)

**To achieve high availability, use**
- Redundancy
- Loose coupling

**To calculate the availibility of redundant components**
- Multiply the failure rate of the components
- Substract that number from 100%
