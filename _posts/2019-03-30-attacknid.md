## Projet : Hack the attacknid

- [raspberrypi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=23695)
The PCB actually has 10x empty spots next to the switch contacts that seem to have been purposely included for this very purpose/testing/development.

First things first though - I will drill some holes and mount 12 GPIO pins on the handset to break it out to connect via wires to the corresponding spots on the PCB.

8 will go to the 8 buttons.
2 will go to the 2 (apparently) ground lines that the 2 clusters of 4 buttons short to.
the other 2 will go to the +3v / gnd supply lines in the battery compartment.

The controller has something that resembles a NRF24L01 RF transceiver in it.
