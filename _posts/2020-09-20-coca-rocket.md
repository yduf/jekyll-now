> If you add liquid gas to lighters and turn a bottle upside down, it will turn into a mega ROCKET!  - [Why does propane added to Coca-Cola take off like a rocket?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFENMe0wc28&has_verified=1)

But why does it happen? The secret is in its boiling point. Propane, butane and iso- butane get boiled at the temperatures lower than surrounding air. Once liquid gas is added to Coca-Cola, it doesn't get mixed, but remains on the top of Coca-Cola. When it reacts with Coca-Cola, it turns into gas and due to this a layer between Coca-Cola and propane occurs. It boils slowly, but if you turn the bottle upside down, the liquids get mixed and propane will immediately evaporate having expanded taking up 500 times more space. High pressure in the bottle takes place. It pushes the mixture out of the bottle giving it recoil impulse.
