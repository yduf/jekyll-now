- []()
> gives you an almost monochrome red-on black. The triplet of numbers are rgb values for the gamma correction, separated by :, in the range of 0-1. Replace 1:0.01:0.01 with 0.01:1:0.01 for green, and 0.01:0.01:1 for blue. This method only works with dark/black backgrounds, because the gamma correction of bright white is just white.

{% highlight cpp %}
xrandr --output $OUTPUT --gamma 1:0.01:0.01
{% endhighlight %}

Use xrandr -q to find the output ID to use for $OUTPUT; my laptop screen is LVDS-1, for instance.
