> The  instruction  we  choose  ismov,  which  can  do  both  loadsand stores. We use no unusual addressing modes, self-modifyingcode, or runtime code generation. Using just this instruction (anda single unconditional branch at the end of the program to makenontermination possible), we demonstrate how an arbitrary Turingmachine can be simulated. - [pdf](http://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22353713)
