> it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.  While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
