## [A Practical Guide to FDM 3D Printing Gears](https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Practical-Guide-to-FDM-3D-Printing-Gears/)

- Print all parts minimum **3 perimeters all sides** top & bottom, with 15% infill. I recommend 0.3mm layer thickness maximum.
- plastic is cheap and your time isn't. If the application is critical or just cumbersome to replace a broken gear on then you may as well print the gear mostly solid to avoid the chance of any non-wear related failure.
- Printed gears usually require a little post processing prior to use. Expect to have to bore holes to the right size & clean up teeth with a blade. 

## The most common failure modes of printed gears
- Tooth wear until slipping
- Tooth breakage.
- Connection to shaft failure.
- Hub or spoke breakage.

## What is the best material?
Nylon > PLA > ABS > PETG

- The drawbacks of nylon are its propensity to absorb water and the difficulty of printing with it.
- PLA has high rigidity and superior wear properties over ABS which make it a better choice when application temperatures allow.
- ABS a better choice for applications involving temperatures above ~75C
- PETG is a ductile material but it is also softer, more flexible, and less scratch resistant than either ABS or PLA which makes it a worse choice for gears.
