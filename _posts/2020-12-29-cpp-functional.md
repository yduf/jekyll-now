> A large fraction of the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding all the possible states their code may execute in. In a multithreaded environment, the lack of understanding and the resulting problems are greatly amplified, almost to the point of panic if you are paying attention. Programming in a functional style makes the state presented to your code explicit, which makes it much easier to reason about, and, in a completely pure system, makes thread race conditions impossible. - [John Carmack (2012)](https://gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3896404) / [(2)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8609775)
