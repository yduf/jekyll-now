[how to use C++ auto](http://swdevmastery.com/dont-use-c-auto-restricting-auto-is-not-the-best-decision-for-your-company-and-it-is-unfair-to-your-developers-instead-train-them-on-how-to-use-it/)

```cpp
  int x = 0;
  int& r = x;
  const int& cr = x;

  const auto& v = x;   // v’s type is “const int&”; auto is “int"
  const auto& cv = cr;   // cv’s type is “const int&”; auto is “int"
  auto* w = &r;   // w’s type is “int*”; auto is “int"
  auto* cw = &cr;   // cw’s type is “const int*”; auto is “const int”

  std::vector<int> vec({1, 2, 3, 4, 5});

  auto& first = vec[0];   // first's type is "int&”; auto is “int” 
```
