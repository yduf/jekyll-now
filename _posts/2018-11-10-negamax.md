## [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax)

- The basis is **MiniMax**,  a literal implementation would involve 2 methods that take turns (mutually recursive), 1 for each side.

- Lazy programmers turn this into **NegaMax**, 
one method with a strategically placed - operator.

Negamax search is a variant form of minimax search that relies on the zero-sum property of a two-player game.
This algorithm relies on the fact that max ( a , b ) = − min ( − a , − b ) {\displaystyle \max(a,b)=-\min(-a,-b)} {\displaystyle \max(a,b)=-\min(-a,-b)} to simplify the implementation of the minimax algorithm.



- **Alpha/Beta pruning** is keeping track of a Window of best moves (over multiple depths) to detect dead branches.
