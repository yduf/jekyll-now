	- Source code browsing (including core C source with the pry-doc gem)
    - Navigation around state (cd, ls and friends)
    - Documentation browsing
    - Live help system
    - Open methods in editors (edit-method Class#method)
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Command shell integration (start editors, run git, and rake from within Pry)
    - Gist integration
    - Runtime invocation (use Pry as a developer console or debugger)
    - Exotic object support (BasicObject instances, IClasses, ...)
    - A powerful and flexible command system
    - Ability to view and replay history
    - Many convenience commands inspired by IPython, Smalltalk and other advanced REPLs
