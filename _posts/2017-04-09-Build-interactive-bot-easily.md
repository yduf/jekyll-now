## Want to build a bot with API.AI

Was at [devoxx 2017 this week](http://devoxx.fr).

After seeing a demo of [API.ai](http://API.ai), I was very impress by how easy you can create an interactive boat that can have some form of complex interaction either by voice or text with a human. API.ai can be used to design the bot interaction, and the backend, can be done on a cloud provider by example.

In a non related talk, I also dicovered the game [Event[0]](http://event0game.com/), where you are interacting with a kind of HAL 9000 computer.  

I Want to play with both...
