> When you stop driving your design first, and primarily, through your tests, your eyes will open to much more interesting perspectives on the code. The answer to how can I make it better, is how can I make it clearer, not how can I test it faster or more isolated. - [The design integrity of your system is far more important than being able to test it any particular layer.](https://dhh.dk/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html) - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15565875)

(Hexagonal design damage as well)

> It's from this unfortunate maxim that much of the test-induced design damage flows. Such damage is defined as changes to your code that either facilitates a) easier test-first, b) speedy tests, or c) unit tests, but does so by harming the clarity of the code through â€” usually through needless indirection and conceptual overhead. Code that is warped out of shape solely to accomodate testing objectives.
