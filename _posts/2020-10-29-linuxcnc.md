> LinuxCNC controls CNC machines. It can drive milling machines, lathes, 3d printers, laser cutters, plasma cutters, robot arms, hexapods, and more. - [LinuxCNC](https://www.linuxcnc.org/)

# Configuration
## [Latency-Test](http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Latency-Test)
- If your "Max Jitter" number is less than about **15-20** microseconds (15000-20000 nanoseconds), the computer should give **very nice** results with software stepping. 
- If the Max Jitter is more like **30-50** microseconds, you can still get **good** results, but your maximum step rate might be a little disappointing, especially if you use microstepping or have very fine pitch leadscrews. 
- If the numbers are **100 uS or more** (100,000 nanoseconds), then the PC is **not a good** candidate for software stepping.
