## [Cute and Efficient Is Definitely Possible](https://github.com/SaadAttieh/lazyCode)

-    Compossible, lazily evaluated generators such as map, filter, fold, enumerated ranges and more.
-    Easy handling of input and output streams, reading line by line, parsing objects, etc.
-    Compact syntax: Choice between
        Functional fold(...,map(...,filter(...)))
        Piped filter(...) | map(...) | fold(...)
-    Zero cost abstractions leveraging C++ templates, no macros involved.
-    Easily create new generators and integrate with existing ones.
-    Optionally enabled macros to make the syntax even more cute.
