> I decided to adapt
my course notes into a how-to, to get you to a cool program as quickly as possible. It will not be
a full-featured ray tracer, but it does have the indirect lighting which has made ray tracing a
staple in movies. Follow these steps, and the architecture of the ray tracer you produce will be
good for extending to a more extensive ray tracer if you get excited and want to pursue that. - [Peter Shirley](https://twitter.com/Peter_shirley)
