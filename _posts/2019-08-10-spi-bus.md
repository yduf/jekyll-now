## [Why use SPI?](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/16349)

I2C lets you connect many devices to a single bus (two wires, plus ground) so it would be the preferred choice if you needed to interrogate a substantial number of devices, perhaps fairly infrequently. However the speed of SPI could be more relevant for situations where you need to output rapidly (eg. a LED strip) or input rapidly (eg. an ADC converter). - [Nick Gammon](http://www.gammon.com.au/spi)
