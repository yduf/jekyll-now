> A* is a modification of Dijkstra’s Algorithm that is optimized for **a single destination**. Dijkstra’s Algorithm can find paths to all locations; A* finds paths to one location, **or the closest of several locations**. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal. - [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
