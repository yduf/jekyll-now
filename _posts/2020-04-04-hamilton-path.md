> A Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once... Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is **NP-complete**.  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)
