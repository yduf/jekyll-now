## [Tutorial](https://github.com/Hapaxia/SelbaWard/wiki/Tutorial%3A-%27Console-Screen%27-Basics)

Console Screen is a C++ class for displaying a console-like screen to a render window.

These screens resemble those screens used by older, text-based computers and displays/windows used by command-line interfaces (aka Console, Shell, Command Line, Terminal).
