## [What is a group mind](https://abe-winter.github.io/2018/07/31/group-mind.html)

A mind that is disconnectable and reconnectable. A brain, for example, is fully physically connected all the time and doesn’t qualify.

It doesn’t need to be ‘as conscious’ as a whole as the individual pieces. But at minimum, to qualify as a combined entity rather than a bucket of individuals, a group mind should be able to:

Enforce priorities (top down) that are relatively consistent over time.
Update priorities (bottom up / random). You can call this creativity if you like; in a singular brain the default mode network handles it.
Chunk out work so that between syncs, mental labor can be parallelized.
The goal is to:

Do cognitive work faster than any individual could, even if the speedup is less than linear
Ideally: solve in finite time problems too large for one individual given infinite time
