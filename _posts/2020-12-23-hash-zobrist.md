> Zobrist is a hash function construction used in computer programs that play abstract board games, such as chess and Go, to implement transposition tables, a special kind of hash table that is indexed by a board position and used to avoid analyzing the same position more than once. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zobrist_hashing)
