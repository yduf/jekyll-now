> So you’ve got a cool black on white drawing, and now you want to color it! The thing we’ll aim for in this tutorial is to get your line art colored in with flat colors. So no shading just yet. We’ll be going through some techniques for preparing the line art, and we’ll be using the layer docker to put each color on a separate layer, so we can easily access each color when we add shading. - [Flat Coloring][https://docs.krita.org/en/tutorials/flat-coloring.html)
