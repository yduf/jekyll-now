title: Influence of infill %
tags: 3dprint
---
> The key parameters we look into are infill %, layer height and infill pattern. In the main body of this study, we provide a detailed description of the influence these parameters have on max stress, elongation at break, rigidity (Young Modulus) and yield stress. - [](https://www.3dprinteros.com/what-is-the-influence-of-infill-layer-height-and-infill-pattern-on-my-3d-prints/)
