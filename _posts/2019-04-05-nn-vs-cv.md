title: Have We Forgotten about Geometry in Computer Vision?
tags: computer-vision NN

> Deep learning has revolutionised computer vision. Today, there are not many problems where the best performing solution is not based on an end-to-end deep learning model. In particular, convolutional neural networks are popular as they tend to work fairly well out of the box... I am going to argue that people often apply deep learning models naively to computer vision problems â€“ and that we can do better. - [article](https://alexgkendall.com/computer_vision/have_we_forgotten_about_geometry_in_computer_vision/)
