## Fun Facts

- the surface of a sphere is the same as it's projection on a containing cylinder.
- it's equal to 4 times it's shadow.
- a rectangle on the sphere and it's projection on the cylinder account for the same surface.

- the surface area for a sphere (4.pi.R^2) is just the derivative of its volume (4/3.pi.R^3).
- the perimeter of a circle (2.pi.R) is the derivative of its area (pi.R^2).
(this should be obvious a fundamental calculus)
