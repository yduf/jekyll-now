> When we first started porting Chrome away from just Windows, we intended to use Scons to build Chrome on all our platforms. But early on in development I discovered that Scons, despite its admirable goals of correctness and ease of use, was quite slow â€” it could take 40 seconds from starting Scons before it decided to build some source... I eventually ported our Linux build to plain Makefiles... Build performance is a combination of many factors: the build system needs to compute what needs to be done, the compiler takes time to compile files, the linker takes time to link. Each of these can be improved;...Makefiles got our incremental builds down to a handful (10-20) of seconds... I thought I'd try making a very simple build system; conceptually very similar to Make, but without hardly any features. And with just some preliminary profiling I got the Chrome build startup to under one second. - [Ninja, a new build system](http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/02/ninja.html)
