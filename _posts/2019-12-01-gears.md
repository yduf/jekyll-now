## What is the best material?
Nylon > PLA > ABS > PETG

- The drawbacks of nylon are its propensity to absorb water and the difficulty of printing with it.
- PLA has high rigidity and superior wear properties over ABS which make it a better choice when application temperatures allow.
- ABS a better choice for applications involving temperatures above ~75C
- PETG is a ductile material but it is also softer, more flexible, and less scratch resistant than either ABS or PLA which makes it a worse choice for gears.
