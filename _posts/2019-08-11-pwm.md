## [PWM has several uses:](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SecretsOfArduinoPWM)

- Dimming an LED
- Providing an analog output; if the digital output is filtered, it will provide an analog voltage between 0% and 100% .
- Generating audio signals.
- Providing variable speed control for motors.
- Generating a modulated signal, for example to drive an infrared LED for a remote control. 

### Simple Pulse Width Modulation with analogWrite

The Arduino's programming language makes PWM easy to use; simply call analogWrite(pin, dutyCycle), where dutyCycle is a value from 0 to 255, and pin is one of the PWM pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, or 11). The analogWrite function provides a simple interface to the hardware PWM, but doesn't provide any control over frequency. (Note that despite the function name, the output is a digital signal, often referred to as a square wave.) 

Probably 99% of the readers can stop here, and just use analogWrite, but there are other options that provide more flexibility.
