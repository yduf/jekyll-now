## [Calibration steps](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/#dimensional-accuracy)

(while moving to klipper I lost most of the setup that was working in Marlin).

1. Have rough Xyz calibration
2. Have bed leveling (plate is not perfect)
3. Have adehsion on first  layer.

4. calibrate extrusion factor
5. recalibrate Z axis (cube XYZ)
6. recalibrate 2 level

Iterate on 4/5/6
