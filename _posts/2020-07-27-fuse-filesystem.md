> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE project consists of two components: the fuse kernel module (maintained in the regular kernel repositories) and the libfuse userspace library (maintained in this repository). libfuse provides the reference implementation for communicating with the FUSE kernel module. - [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)

## [Building your own filesystem](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/#building-your-own-filesystem)

libfuse offers two APIs: a "high-level", synchronous API, and a "low-level" asynchronous API. In both cases, incoming requests from the kernel are passed to the main program using callbacks. 
- When using the high-level API, the callbacks may work with file names and paths instead of inodes, and processing of a request finishes when the callback function returns. 
- When using the low-level API, the callbacks must work with inodes and responses must be sent explicitly using a separate set of API functions.

The documentation of the API functions and necessary callbacks is mostly contained in the files:
- [include/fuse.h](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/include/fuse.h) (for the high-level API)
- and [include/fuse_lowlevel.h](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/include/fuse_lowlevel.h) (for the low-level API). 

An autogenerated html version of the API is available in the doc/html directory and at http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen.
